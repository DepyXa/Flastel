<h1>Flastel</h1>
  <h4>A new module for creating Telegram bot's.</h4>
  Designed specifically to create a bot on your site using a webhook. You will be able to create multiple bots on your site by configuring them on your host. Mode is also supported "polling" to create a bot on another server without requesting your site's code. With the method "webhook" you won't need your host to support multimode. No need to create a bot background anymore.
This module is a support for weak hosting, which allows you to save money.
